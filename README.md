# Enterprise-Architecture-GDPR-Compliance-Analysis

The project explores the advancements in technology and the concerns surrounding privacy in the context of data storage systems. It specifically delves into San Francisco based start-up, a software service provider aiding small businesses, focusing on the data architecture for a burger restaurant chain on the U.S. east coast. Despite primarily serving U.S. clients, the analysis shows potential GDPR compliance as start-up expands its services in Europe. The GDPR, effective since May 25, 2018, mandates data protection for EU organizations or those processing data related to EU individuals, aiming to enhance the safeguarding of personal data and its free movement.
